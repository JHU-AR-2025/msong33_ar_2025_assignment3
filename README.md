Repository Description:
- Problem 3: Spawn a 3d model with a hit test and use your controller (right thumb stick) to move the model on the horizontal plane.
- Problem 4: OpenGL parameters
    - Can calculate pixel coordinates (uv) of a given camera point with customizable camera intrinsics and OpenGL parameters
- Problem 5: Phong Reflection Model
    - Implemented classic Phong shading and Phong reflection model, experimenting with various lighting conditions (adding a second point light) and lighting/material parameters

Instructions:
- Problem 3: View the following link for a preview of the environment on the browser in Babylon.js Playground. https://playground.babylonjs.com/#XWBES1#857 . Additionally, you can download the index.html file similar to problem 5.
- Problem 4: Download the MATLAB file and change the relevant parameters to calculate pixel coordinates of interest
- Problem 5: Download the index.html file and open it in a browser to run the environment.
